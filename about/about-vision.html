      Trained To Grow Inc. fully dedicates time and effort into encouraging,
      empowering and supporting youth. Through the benefit of new relationships
      and character building projects, the youth of TTG Inc. will learn
      important moral and leadership qualities that will help them thrive in a
      positive environment. TTG Inc. programs are designed to meet the needs of
      challenge deprived youth who lack an abundance of healthy support systems,
      strong guidance, and positive encouragement. â€‹Our target group is youth between the ages of 12-18 in/or transitioning out of legal custody (or at risk). We hope to collaborate with other youth services to guarantee that said youth have an opportunity to learn, grow and thrive. We alone cannot provide everything needed for our youth, it takes us all to ensure all needs are met.
